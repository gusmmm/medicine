- High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy has gained attention in recent years for its potential benefits in improving oxygenation and patient safety during complex gastroenterological procedures.
	- HFNC may be particularly advantageous in procedures requiring deep sedation or those with increased risk of hypoxemia.
- Some complex gastroenterological procedures that might benefit from HFNC include
	- Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
		- This procedure involves the examination and treatment of the bile and pancreatic ducts. It often requires deep sedation, and patients may experience oxygen desaturation due to the longer duration and complexity of the procedure.
	- Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD)
		- ESD is a technique used to remove early-stage gastrointestinal tumors from the mucosal and submucosal layers. The procedure can be lengthy and technically challenging, increasing the risk of hypoxemia.
	- Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)
		- Similar to ESD, EMR is a technique for removing early-stage gastrointestinal tumors but is less invasive. It may still require deep sedation, and patients could benefit from the improved oxygenation provided by HFNC.
	- Enteroscopy
		- This procedure involves the examination of the small intestine using a specialized endoscope. It can be a lengthy procedure, and deep sedation is often required. HFNC may help maintain oxygenation throughout the procedure.
	- Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)
		- EUS combines endoscopy with ultrasound technology to visualize and sample areas of the gastrointestinal tract and adjacent organs. Some EUS procedures can be complex and require deep sedation, making HFNC a potential option for optimizing oxygenation.
	- Complex Colonoscopy
		- Although most colonoscopies are performed under moderate sedation, certain cases, such as those involving extensive polyp removal or patients with comorbidities, may require deeper sedation. HFNC could be beneficial in maintaining adequate oxygenation during these procedures.
- Patient selection, procedure type, and individual risk factors should be considered when deciding to use HFNC during gastroenterological procedures
