- The study’s primary outcome was occurrence of one or more hypoxemia events during anesthesia. A hypoxemia event was defined as Spo 2 <92% for at least 15 consecutive seconds

- Anesthetic drugs were limited to propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam, except in the case of emergent endotracheal intubation, where providers could use neuromuscular-blocking drugs.

- Twenty-eight patients (21.2%) in the HFNC oxygen group had one or more hypoxemia events compared to 43 patients(33.1%) in the SNC group. The absolute risk reduction with HFNC oxygen was 11.9%, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 8.4.
