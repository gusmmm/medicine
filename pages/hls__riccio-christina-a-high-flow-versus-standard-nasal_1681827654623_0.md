- After induction of sedation with a lidocaine bolus up to 100 mg and a propofol bolus up to 100 mg intravenously, a propofol infusion was titrated to a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score of −3 to −4. The RASS score was designed to have precise, unambiguous definitions for varying depths of sedation based on assessment of arousal, cognition and sustainability. A score of −3 to −4 describes moderate to deep sedation, whereas patients exhibit little or no movement to voice and physical stimulation

- to the HFNC group received the HFNC 5 min prior to the start of sedation at a setting of 36–40% FiO 2. The flow rate was titrated up to the maximum setting of 60 liters per minute (LPM)

- In this prospective, randomized clinical trial we observed no difference in incidence of desaturations below 90% found in morbidly obese colonoscopy patients treated with supplemental oxygen via SNC(4 LPM) vs. HFNC (FiO 2 0.36–0.4, 60 LPM). There was also no difference found in airway interventions performed by the anesthesia providers between the two groups. Based on these findings the DMC stopped the trial at the interim analysis.

- 14 out of 31 patients (45.2%) had at least one desaturation episode < 90%. In the HFNC group, 11 out of 28 patients(39.3%) had at least one desaturation episode < 90% (p = 0.79).
