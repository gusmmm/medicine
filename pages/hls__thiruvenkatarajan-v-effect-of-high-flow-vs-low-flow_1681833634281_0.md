- In high-risk patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, oxygen therapy with high-flow nasal oxygen did not reduce the rate of hypoxaemia, hypercarbia or the need for airway interventions, compared with combined oral and nasal lowflow oxygen.

- Hypoxaemic events were observed in 7.7% (5/65) of participants in the HFNO group and 9.1% (6/66) in the lowflow nasal plus mouthguard oxygen group (difference1.4%, 95%CI 10.9–8.0; p = 0.77)

- Our study demonstrated that, in high-risk patients undergoing ERCP within the context of target-controlled infusion based propofol administration, oxygen delivery using HFNO did not reduce the rate of hypoxaemia, hypercarbia and the need for major and minor airway interventions, compared with low-flow nasal plus mouthguard oxygen.
