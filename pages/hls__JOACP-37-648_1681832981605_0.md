- HFNC use in patients undergoing EUS is not superior when compared to conventional nasal cannula oxygen therapy. HFNC failed to show any significant impact on decreasing the risk of desaturation events and airway manipulation during the procedure.

- 1 μg/kg fentanyl and 1.5 mg/kg propofol bolus over 30 s, which was followed by an infusion of propofol (25–100mcg/kg/min) using a syringe pump to maintain a target BIS of 50–60 during the procedure.
