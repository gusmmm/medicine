- The study population consisted of 72 patients aged 20 yr and older with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I-IV, and who underwent ERCP in the prone position.

- Then, in the control group, 100% oxygen was administered at 5 Lmin-1 via a nasal cannula throughout the procedure. In the HFNO group, 100% oxygen was administered at 50 Lmin-1 via an HFNO system (OptiFlow THRIVE, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Panmure, Auckland, New Zealand) throughout the procedure

- The present study revealed that HFNO use could improve oxygenation during ERCP in the prone position compared with conventional management using a nasal cannula. In addition, no episodes of hypoxemia or hypercapnia occurred with HFNO use
